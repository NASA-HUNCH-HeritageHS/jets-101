# jets-101
Mobile application to prevent jet lag by dynamically schedule activities and sleep.
Possibly changing to a web app, because I(Aaron) am getting really frustrated with Android Studio, and I atleast have the ability to make something easily with HTML and CSS. For now, it will be only html and css, js(app behaviour) will come later.
